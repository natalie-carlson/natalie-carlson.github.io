          <p>Small unregistered firms contribute to a substantial proportion of global economic activity, particularly in developing regions. In explaining variation in productivity in these types of informal firms, research has focused primarily on the adoption of effective business practices and access to capital, with little focus on fundamental positioning. This article explores the nature of differentiation in microenterprises, introducing a text‐based measure of differentiation using state‐of‐the‐art sentence embeddings. Using a combined sample of nearly 10,000 microenterprises across eight developing countries, I examine whether (and which) microenterprises differentiate, whether differentiation is related to performance (and for whom), and whether any existing policy interventions affect differentiation.  </a></p>

          <p>We demonstrate how a novel synthesis of three methods—(a) unsupervised topic modeling of text data to generate new measures of textual variance, (b) sentiment analysis of text data, and (c) supervised ML coding of facial images with a cutting-edge convolutional neural network algorithm—can shed light on questions related to CEO oral communication. With videos and corresponding transcripts of interviews with emerging market CEOs, we use this synthesis of methods to discover five distinct communication styles that incorporate both verbal and nonverbal aspects of communication. Our data comprises interviews that represent unedited expressions and content, making them especially suitable as data sources for the measurement of an individual's communication style. We then perform a proof-of-concept analysis, correlating CEO communication styles to M&A outcomes, highlighting the value of combining text and videographic data to define styles. We also discuss the benefits of using our methods versus current research methods.</a></p>

          <p>The emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has opened new avenues for integrating artificial intelligence into the research process. One of the most promising early applications identified by social scientists is the use of LLMs for data annotation and text classification, a task traditionally performed either manually, with keyword methods, or through the development of customized machine learning tools. However, the benefits and opportunities of this particular use case of the technology remain poorly understood, and critically, the risks and potential downsides of the use of such technology in the research process have been largely unexplored. We examine the performance of ChatGPT in a research task for which we had previously developed a machine learning model at great effort and expense: identifying claims about sustainability in crowdfunding projects, based on the project text. We find that, with some prompt refinement, ChatGPT can easily match the performance of prior methods in annotating texts, at a great reduction in cost and time. However, our study also unearths that minor, seemingly inconsequential prompt variations can result in significantly different labels which, in turn, have implications for the robustness of downstream analyses and result interpretations.  Through a sensitivity analysis of hypothetical downstream regressions, we demonstrate how prompt engineering can markedly alter result interpretations, and even enable the potential of unethical fishing for desired results. To guard against these risks, we develop a method we call Prompt Variance Estimation (PVE) to provide robustness to analyses that use LLM-generated labels, and provide instructions and code for its use.  </a></p>

          <h6>Ucel, C. and Carlson, N.A. <a> “The Role of Knowledge Intermediaries in Helping Microenterprises Optimize Practice Adoption Under Constraint.”</a> </h6>
          <p>Much of the world's economic activity is still produced by small operations such as microenterprises or smallholder farms, who frequently operate below the productivity frontier. Research suggests that a failure to implement best practices often dogs these small operations, but an understanding of which frictions prevent optimal practice adoption is still lacking. In this study we examine how physical access to expert knowledge affects practice diffusion and productivity, drawing on a proprietary dataset of 1480 smallholder coconut farmers in the Philippines. Leveraging variation in the proximity of farms to agricultural extension offices, we show that productivity (i.e., crop yields) increases steadily with increased physical access to experts. Similarly, awareness of eight best practices for coconut farming (known as GAP 1-8) increases along with expert access. Examining the chain from practice awareness to implementation to productivity, however, reveals a more complex picture: access to expert knowledge is associated with increased adoption of some practices and decreased adoption of others. We investigate this finding, discovering three distinct patterns of practice adoption, two positively associated with expert access and one negatively associated. We find that the benefits of each bundle of practices are contingent on the presence of other sources of income (e.g., how much time investment the proprietor is putting into the farm), the ability to afford advanced inputs such as chemical pesticides, and the material support of external institutions such as cooperatives or fair trade. We suggest that proprietors of micro-operations face a fairly complex optimization problem in determining which "best" practices to adopt, and that experts may serve an important role in helping proprietors identify the most advantageous suite of practices. </a></p>

          <p>We examine how human capital at an MNC’s headquarters affects its foreign product expansion choices. We theorize that immigrant workers hired at HQ are channels of country-specific knowledge and connections that facilitate three types of product-related decisions in their home country markets: launching new products, updating existing products, and adapting products to local conditions. Drawing on two remarkably fine-grained datasets, we examine 74,906 product launches by 340 US-based multinationals in the consumer packaged goods industry in 83 foreign markets during 2009-2019, matched to 7,876 skilled immigrant hires (on H-1B visas) by these firms over the same time period. The more immigrants from a given country a firm hires in the US, the more its subsequent products in that country exhibit locally-specific features. Hiring immigrants also leads to more frequent updates of preexisting products, especially in culturally distant markets relative to the US. Immigrants also help firms launch more new products in geographically distant countries after they are hired. These associations are stronger for more culturally-specific products (i.e., food and beverages vs. household and personal care) and hold only when immigrants occupy product-related roles (e.g., R&D, marketing, management) but not when they have non-product-related roles (e.g. accounting). Our study provides granular insights on the role of human capital across critical phases of global product strategy: new product development, local adaptation capability, and ongoing product management. </a></p>
