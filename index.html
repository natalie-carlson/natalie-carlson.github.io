          <p>We demonstrate how a novel synthesis of three methods—(a) unsupervised topic modeling of text data to generate new measures of textual variance, (b) sentiment analysis of text data, and (c) supervised ML coding of facial images with a cutting-edge convolutional neural network algorithm—can shed light on questions related to CEO oral communication. With videos and corresponding transcripts of interviews with emerging market CEOs, we use this synthesis of methods to discover five distinct communication styles that incorporate both verbal and nonverbal aspects of communication. Our data comprises interviews that represent unedited expressions and content, making them especially suitable as data sources for the measurement of an individual's communication style. We then perform a proof-of-concept analysis, correlating CEO communication styles to M&A outcomes, highlighting the value of combining text and videographic data to define styles. We also discuss the benefits of using our methods versus current research methods.</a></p>

          <p>Evidence of the effectiveness of entrepreneurial training programs in developing countries has been mixed, and frequently disappointing from the perspective of policy makers. Prior studies have often focused narrowly on business practice adoption, survival, and performance, with less attention to how training affects decisions about which core business ideas to pursue. In this article, we propose that the main benefit from such programs lies not in introducing new practices, but in helping to reduce uncertainty about the relative value of business opportunities. In this way, training may facilitate better decisions about when to “stay the course” (invest further in an existing business) or “start over” (pivot to a new idea). In a randomized field experiment, we examine this question in the context of small informal businesses in Zimbabwe, studying an entrepreneurial training program developed by an international NGO. We show that, on average, assignment to training made the entrepreneurs in this study more likely to expand or modify their existing business, and less likely to start over with a new business. This stay-the-course effect was moderated by baseline performance: that is, assignment to the training program made entrepreneurs more likely to persist with a high-performing business. We show that, roughly nine months post training, the highest business performance was found in those who invested or expanded on their current business, and that new practice adoption was not associated with performance.</p>

          <p>Small unregistered firms contribute to a substantial proportion of global economic activity, particularly in developing regions. In explaining variation in productivity in these types of informal firms, research has focused primarily on the adoption of effective business practices and steps towards formalization, with little focus on fundamental positioning. This article explores the relationship between differentiation in microen- terprises and business performance outcomes. I develop two text-based measure of differentiation – one using a simple cosine distance approach with word vectors, and another using state-of-the-art sentence embeddings – and show that both correlate with performance in a sample of 623 microenterprises in Zimbabwe, being positively associated with revenues, profits, and employment. To assess the robustness of this finding, I then conduct a meta-analysis with a combined sample of approximately 10,000 microenterprises across seven additional developing countries. The meta-analysis estimates that a standard deviation increase in differentiation is associated with 22-27 percent more employees, 9-12 percent higher revenues, and 9-10 percent higher profits. The findings suggest that differentiation is a relevant predictor of performance even in the smallest of microenterprises, and provide an example of a methodological approach to measuring differentiation using multilingual text.</p>

        <h6>Zhao, J., Carlson, N.A., Ichniowski, C., & Kogut, B. “Practices and Culture in Multilevel Organizations: Evidence from Microfinance Institutions in India.” </h6>
        <p>Microfinance is a social technology that uses peer-to-peer social pressure to enforce and encourage repayment.  By 2010, there existed over 100 million borrowers throughout the world with loans at microfinance institutions (MFIs), hierarchical organizations with loan activities carried out at local branches nested within a larger corporate structure. In this study we examine the determinants of performance at the local branch level, using a detailed survey to collect financial data, managerial practices, and employee attitudes at over 400 local branches of 19 MFIs in India. We show that while lending practices tend to be standardized across MFIs, organizational culture – specifically the prosocial attitudes of employees – varies considerably at the local level. Moreover, measures of prosocial culture are strongly and positively associated with local branch productivity and appear to reflect a founding imprint: branches of firms founded as non-profit evince a strong prosocial culture even after shifting to a for-profit business model. The results emphasize the importance of the prosocial culture in branches, with headquarters responsible for the routinization of practices across branches.  We introduce three broad propositions with relevance to hierarchical organizations: first, that while practices may be corporate, culture is local. Second, local culture is likely to reflect an imprint of founding conditions. Third, local culture will predict variance in local performance.</p>
